PROBLEM:
Given a weight in pounds and a height in feet, output the BMI in kg/m^2


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m


Problem inputs:
Weight in lbs
Height in inches

Problem outputs:
BMI in kg/m^2

Relevant formulas:
BMI = (lbs / lb_kg)/(in * in_m)^2

Test data:
200 lbs
72 in
=
90.719 kg
1.829 m
=
BMI = 27.119 kg/m^2

DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:
BMI = (lbs / lb_kg)/(in * in_m)^2


Completed algorithm with refinements:
BMI = (lbs * lb_kg)/(in * in_m * in * in_m)

IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
