PROBLEM:

Input member information for some number of new members.
Then print a summary of each member's information to the screen.


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m

   const double in_m = 0.0254 ;
   const double lb_kg = 0.453597 ;
   const double inmin = 59.0 ;
   const double inmax = 78.0 ;
   const double lbsmin = 90.0 ;
   const double lbsmax = 350.0 ;
   const double BMImin = 18.5 ;
   const double BMImax = 30.0 ;


Problem inputs:
Weight in pounds
Height in inches
BMI in kilograms per meter squared

Problem outputs:
BMI in kilograms per meter squared
Weight in pounds

Relevant formulas:
BMI = (lbs * lb_kg)/(in * in_m * in * in_m)
Weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) / lb_kg

Test data:

Enter the number of new members: 1
=======Member 001 Info=======
Enter the gender, m for male or f for female: m
weight:165
Height: 72
BMI: 22.38 kg/m^2
Enter the target BMI in kilograms per meter squared: 20
Target weight: 147.47 pounds

=============================
Summary of Member 001

Height:              72.00
Weight:             165.00
Gender:                  m
BMI:                 22.38
Classification:     normal
IBW:                171.08
Target BMI:          20.00
Target Weight:      147.47
=============================


DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:
prompt for number of new members
prompt for gender
check gender
prompt for weight and height
check for weight and height for accuracy
calculate BMI when accurate input is entered
check BMI for accuracy
prompt for target BMI
calculate target weight
calculate IBW for specified gender
print member summary
member #next...etc.

Completed algorithm with refinements:
prompt for number of new members
prompt for gender
check gender
prompt for weight and height
check for weight and height for accuracy
calculate BMI when accurate input is entered
check BMI for accuracy
prompt for target BMI
calculate target weight
calculate IBW for specified gender
print member summary
member #next...etc.

IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
