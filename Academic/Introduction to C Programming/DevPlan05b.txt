PROBLEM:

Read memberInfo.txt
Calculate BMI, IBW, and tgtlbs for tgtBMI of 25.0
Print summary to screen
stop when sentinel value is read


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m

   const double in_m = 0.0254 ;
   const double lb_kg = 0.453597 ;
   const double inmin = 59.0 ;
   const double inmax = 78.0 ;
   const double lbsmin = 90.0 ;
   const double lbsmax = 350.0 ;
   const double BMImin = 18.5 ;
   const double BMImax = 30.0 ;


Problem inputs:
none

Problem outputs:
member info table


Relevant formulas:
BMI = (lbs * lb_kg)/(in * in_m * in * in_m)
target weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) / lb_kg
IBW = (50.0 + 2.3 * (in - 60)) / lb_kg ;
IBW = (45.5 + 2.3 * (in - 60)) / lb_kg ;


Test data:
Member# Height Weight Gender    BMI  TgtWeight  Classification
    001  72.0   165.0      M  22.38     184.33  normal
    002  70.0   160.0      M  22.96     174.23  normal


DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:

Read memberInfo.txt
Calculate BMI, IBW, and tgtlbs for tgtBMI of 25.0
Print summary to screen
stop when sentinel value is read


Completed algorithm with refinements:

Read memberInfo.txt
Calculate BMI, IBW, and tgtlbs for tgtBMI of 25.0
Print summary to screen
stop when sentinel value is read



IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
