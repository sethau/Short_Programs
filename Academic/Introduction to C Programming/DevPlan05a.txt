PROBLEM:

Create memberInfo file to hold body information for new members.
Get info from user.
Check to ensure accurate user input and feasible results.
Save file with sentinel value at end for file reader.


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m

   const double in_m = 0.0254 ;
   const double lb_kg = 0.453597 ;
   const double inmin = 59.0 ;
   const double inmax = 78.0 ;
   const double lbsmin = 90.0 ;
   const double lbsmax = 350.0 ;
   const double BMImin = 18.5 ;
   const double BMImax = 30.0 ;


Problem inputs:
Height in inches
Weight in pounds


Problem outputs:
member_number height weight


Relevant formulas:
none


Test data:

Enter the number of new members: 1
=======Member 001 Info=======
Height: 72
Weight: 165
Gender: m
1  72.00 165.00 M
 

DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:

Create memberInfo file to hold body information for new members.
Get info from user.
Check to ensure accurate user input and feasible results.
Save file with sentinel value at end for file reader.
member #next...etc.


Completed algorithm with refinements:

Create memberInfo file to hold body information for new members.
Get info from user.
Check to ensure accurate user input and feasible results.
Save file with sentinel value at end for file reader.
member #next...etc.


IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
