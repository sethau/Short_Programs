PROBLEM:
Given a weight in pounds and a height in feet, output the BMI in kg/m^2.

Then, using the previously given height in inches and a target BMI in kilograms per meter squared,
calculate and print the target weight in pounds to the screen.


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m


Problem inputs:
Height in inches
BMI in kilograms per meter squared

Problem outputs:
Weight in lbs

Relevant formulas:
Weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) / lb_kg

Test data:
BMI = 20
in = 72 
=
lbs = 147.47

DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:
Weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) * lb_kg

Completed algorithm with refinements:
Weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) / lb_kg

IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
