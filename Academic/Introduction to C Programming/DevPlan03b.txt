PROBLEM:
Given a weight in pounds and a height in feet, output the BMI in kg/m^2.

Check to ensure accurate user input and feasible results.

Then, using the previously given height in inches and a target BMI in kilograms per meter squared,
calculate and print the target weight in pounds to the screen.


ANALYSIS:
Problem constants:
1kg = 2.2046 lbs
1” = 2.54 cm = 0.0254 m

   const double in_m = 0.0254 ;
   const double lb_kg = 0.453597 ;
   const double inmin = 59.0 ;
   const double inmax = 78.0 ;
   const double lbsmin = 90.0 ;
   const double lbsmax = 350.0 ;
   const double BMImin = 18.5 ;
   const double BMImax = 30.0 ;


Problem inputs:
Weight in pounds
Height in inches
BMI in kilograms per meter squared

Problem outputs:
BMI in kilograms per meter squared
Weight in pounds

Relevant formulas:
BMI = (lbs * lb_kg)/(in * in_m * in * in_m)
Weight = BMI * (height * in_m * height * in_m) / lb_kg

Test data:
Enter your gender, m for male or f for female.
a 
Enter your gender, m for male or f for female.
Enter your gender, m for male or f for female.
m
Enter your weight in lbs and your height in inches, separated by a space.
800 10
weight outside acceptable range
Please enter weight in pounds between 90.0 and 350.0
165
height outside acceptable range
Please enter height in inches between 59.0 and 78.0.
80
height outside acceptable range
Please enter height in inches between 59.0 and 78.0.
72
The BMI is 22.38 kilograms per meters squared.

Enter the target BMI in kilograms per meters squared.
20
The target weight is 147.47 ponds for a BMI of 20.00.
Your IBW is 171.08 pounds.


DESIGN:
Initial algorithm:
prompt for gender
check gender
prompt for weight and height
check for weight and height for accuracy
calculate BMI when accurate input is entered
print BMI
check BMI for accuracy
prompt for target BMI
alculate target weight
print target weight
calculate IBW for specified gender
print IBW

Completed algorithm with refinements:
prompt for gender
check gender
prompt for weight and height
check for weight and height for accuracy
calculate BMI when accurate input is entered
print BMI
check BMI for accuracy
prompt for target BMI
alculate target weight
print target weight
calculate IBW for specified gender
print IBW
IMPLEMENTATION:
This will be your writing your C program using the above development plan. Do not type your program here. You will submit it as a .c file.
